Steps:
1- Plug the ESP32 to your PC by using micro cable.
2- Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager > from the search bar write "esp32" > click on install.
3- Go to Tools > Board > select the name of your ESP32 board.
4- Go to Tools > Port and select a COM port available.
5- write the following code in arduion editor :

/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
